Unfortunately, I could not get the project to execute the way I wanted to. For some reason my print statements aren't showing up when i run the code. I 
employed some of the TA's and the tutor's help, and was making good progress, but missed the last couple SI meetings before spring break. 
After the eighth step where I implement generics, the "printOutputfile" method cites several errors saying it doesn't recognize the getters from the
"car" class even though they are public. Other than that, I could not see a reason why it would not execute, but will look into before my 
presentation slot.
