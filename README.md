Unfortunately, I could not get the project to execute the way I wanted to, largely due to my heavy procrastination. I 
employed some of the TA's and upperclassmen's help but missed the last couple SI meetings before spring break. After the eigth 
step where I implement generics, the "printOutputfile" cites several errors saying it doesn't recognize the getters from the
"car" class even though they are public. Other than that, I could not see a reason why it would not execute.
